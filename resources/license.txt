 * Portions of the included code were adapted from a variety of sources including 
 * the JWNL and Jawbone WordNet packages, and the FreeTTS, CMU-pronunciation, and 
 * PENN treebank libraries. It also includes modified versions of several canonical 
 * NLP algorithms, including pluralization via Minnen, Carroll, and Pearce, and 
 * stemming via the Brill, Porter and Lancaster (Paice/Husk) algorithms, as well
 * as Penner's easing functions. I would like to thank all of those involved in 
 * these projects for their generous efforts.
