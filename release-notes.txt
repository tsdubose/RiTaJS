1.0.50
-------------------

-- RiWordNet is now included as part of the RiTa core

---- The WordNet database no longer comes bundled with the library. Instead, download it first, then point to your installation in the RiWordNet constructor:

	RiWordNet wordnet = new RiWordNet("/WordNet-3.1");

---- Methods returning a String[] will return a zero-length array when the query term is not found, or there are no entries for the relation type being sought, rather than null (as they did in previous versions).
---- In the default configuration, compound-words and uppercase-words are no longer ignored (as they were in previous versions)
---- Processing's core.jar is no longer required.
