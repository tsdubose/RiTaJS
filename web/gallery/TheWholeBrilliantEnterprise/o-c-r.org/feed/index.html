				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_08_26-15_25_12.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1222" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_08_26-15_25_12-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_08_26-15_25_12" width="640" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>Check-ins and synch-ups. Kick-offs and roundtables. Weeklies and monthlies and quarterlies and yearlies. Staff meetings and team meetings and board meetings and all-hands meetings. Meeting before meetings, meetings to plan meetings: meetings, meetings, meetings.</p>
<p>Last week at The OCR, we spent a total of 44 employee-hours in meetings, which works out to about 5 hours each, or about 13% of the work week. Looking at our shared calendar from the last few months I can see a kind of ebb and flow of our meeting frequency as we start and finish projects, and engage with different groups. Indeed, these stacks of coloured blocks are a data visualization of meeting activity within The OCR.</p>
<p>We have 9 employees, which means that this calendar-as-visualization approach is enough to get a sense of our meeting patterns and frequency. If we had twice as many people, this strategy might still be feasible. But with 100 employees? Or 1000? Or 10,000?</p>
<p>It is useful to think of organizations as a networked entities. If the people in these networks are the nodes, then meetings are the edges: the connective tissue in the network. Understanding these connections is key to understanding organizational structure, and can offer a tremendous advantage in making decisions around how organizations can and will change.</p>
<p>But how do we see these networked structures?</p>
<p>Working closely with Microsoft&#8217;s Envisioning Group, we developed Convene, a prototype visualization tool for exploring and understanding meeting activity across large organizations.</p>
<p><em>* Names of individuals and departments, as well as meeting descriptions, have been anonymized in the graphics in this post.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/121482861" width="935" height="527" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The Prototype</strong></p>
<p>Convene is an exploratory visualization tool designed to run on large, touch-enabled screens (in the studio and at the Envisioning Center, it runs on 82&#8243; Perceptive Pixel displays). </p>
<p>Convene offers three connected views of meeting data: Map View, Network View and Graph View. Users can switch seamlessly between these views using simple touch gestures. Each view offers a different approach in understanding meeting activity; together they provide detailed insight into connectivity across the organization.</p>
<p>The first view, Map View, presents a &#8216;high altitude&#8217; rendering of the organization. Every employee is represented as a single dot, and is positioned according to their rank and department. The highest ranking employees (CEO &amp; executives) are at the center of the graph; contractors are at the outer edge. In this view, meetings are rendered as lines between employees. An interactive timeline at the bottom of the screen allows users to examine high-level meeting patterns over days and weeks &#8211; as the timeline is moved, different areas of the organization &#8216;light up&#8217; as meeting activity increases.</p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_09_19-16_54_25_blackWEB.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1232" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_09_19-16_54_25_blackWEB-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_09_19-16_54_25_blackWEB" width="640" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>This dense map of the organization is fully zoomable. Users can focus on specific areas of the company, right down to individual employees. When an employee is selected, a map of the other employees with whom they met during the selected time frame is overlaid on top of the interface.</p>
<p>Groups of users can be selected by double-clicking on an employee&#8217;s ID tag, and identified for analysis within Network View or Graph View. These employees are filed into an interactive &#8216;sorting drawer&#8217; at the top of the screen which can be used to further refine the subset of meetings being analyzed.</p>
<p>Using a simple touch gesture, users can move Map View into a three-dimensional representation, in which employees rise off the surface of the map depending on custom criteria. In the default mode, users with many meetings to the top, while users with only a few meetings stay on the visualization map&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>In this way, the organizational map becomes a piece of data terrain, in which unusual clusters of meeting activity can be easily identified.</p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_08_26-17_16_59.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1223" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_08_26-17_16_59-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_08_26-17_16_59" width="640" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second view, Network View, allows for fine-grain examination of &#8220;meeting networks&#8221; within the organization. Here, meetings involving the cluster of employees in the &#8216;sorting drawer&#8217; (project team, focus group, small department)  are rendered in space. Each meeting is represented by a simplified, circular, table-like icon. These icons show at a glance how many people attended the meeting (each employee is represented by a dot), which departments they belong to (indicated by dot color), and how long the meeting lasted (represented by the diameter of the circular &#8216;table&#8217;).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1231" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_09_19-16_52_04-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_09_19-16_52_04" width="640" height="359" /></p>
<p>The &#8216;tables&#8217; themselves are colored as well, and color is used to indicate two unique meeting metrics that we have built into Convene: breadth, and depth.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1219" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_08_26-15_21_58-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_08_26-15_21_58" width="640" height="359" /></p>
<p>Meeting breadth indicates how wide a range of employees, across the organization, attended the meeting. A meeting with attendees that all work in a single group in the same department will have a very low breadth. If the same meeting were to involve members from a different group in the same department, the breadth score would be higher. Finally, a meeting with with members from different groups across different departments would have a high breadth score (even more so if the departments were further apart on the organizational map).</p>
<p>Meeting depth represents the range of seniority among attendees of a meeting. A meeting which involved the CEO and an intern would have a very high depth score, while one with a group of managers at the same seniority level would have a low depth score.</p>
<p>To see the topic of a certain meeting, users can simply tap on the circular &#8216;table&#8217; representing that meeting. Connections are drawn between meetings when they have shared attendees, so meetings with many people in common are drawn tighter together, while those with only a few attendees remain at the outer edges. Moving the timeline provides a time-based playback of how meeting clusters grow, shrink, form, and disperse.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1220" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_08_26-15_22_55-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_08_26-15_22_55" width="640" height="359" /></p>
<p>Using Network view, users can ask and answer a variety of questions. Which employees within a group are meeting across the organization? How many meetings in a week involve people from outside of the group? When and how often do members of a group meet with executives?</p>
<p>Finally, Graph view offers an intuitive interface for plotting various meeting-specific parameters over time. Batches of meetings can be placed onto one or two axis charts, whose axes can be switched to represent any available parameter (ie. depth, breadth, meeting length).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1229" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_09_19-16_51_18-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_09_19-16_51_18" width="640" height="359" /></p>
<p>To facilitate comparison, graphs can be &#8216;cleaved&#8217;, and sets of two to nine graphs can be compared side-by side.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1230" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meetings2014_09_19-16_51_58-1024x575.png" alt="meetings2014_09_19-16_51_58" width="640" height="359" /></p>
<p>Each of Convene&#8217;s three views offer unique ways to understand organizational meeting patterns. The large-screen touch interface makes it easy for users to navigate between views, and also offers opportunities for multiple people to interrogate the data at the same time.</p>
<p>Meeting activity in organizations of any size is largely opaque: we know that meetings are happening, but we are mostly unable to understand the patterns and structure that underlie them. By visualizing the &#8220;meeting network&#8221;, and by showing how this network is exercised, Convene offers unique insight into a poorly understood aspect of large organizations.</p>
<p>The Office for Creative Research and the Microsoft Envisioning Group are continuing to develop Convene. Please get in touch if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Convene was built using Processing 2.0, and runs as a Windows-native application. The tool that you see in the images and video in this post is the result of an iterative process, which will be explained in greater detail in a follow-up post on this blog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3027.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1192" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3027-1024x682.jpg" alt="Specimen_Box:Cleaving" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is your computer doing when you’re not watching?</strong></p>
<p>You might not personally be in the business of identity theft, spam delivery, or distributed hacking, but there’s a decent chance that your computer is. “Botnets” are criminal networks of computers that, unbeknownst to their owners, are being put to use for any number of nefarious purposes. Across the globe, millions of PCs have been infected with software that conscripts them into one of these networks, silently transforming these machines into accomplices in illegal activities and putting their users’ information at risk.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/government/ww/safety-defense/initiatives/pages/digital-crimes-unit.aspx">Digital Crimes Unit</a> has been tracking and neutralizing these threats for several years.  In January, DCU asked The Office for Creative Research to explore novel ways to visualize botnet activity. The result is Specimen Box, a prototype exploratory tool that allows DCU’s investigators to examine the unique profiles of various botnets, focusing on the geographic and time-based communication patterns of millions of infected machines.</p>
<p>Specimen Box enables investigators to study a botnet the way a naturalist might examine a specimen collected in the wild:  What are its unique characteristics?  How does it behave?  How does it propagate itself?  How is it adapting to a changing environment?</p>
<p>Specimen Box combines visualization and sonification capabilities in a large-screen, touch-based application. Investigators can see and hear both live activity and historical ‘imprints’ of daily patterns across a set of 15 botnets. Because every botnet has its own unique properties, the visual and sonic portraits generated by the tool offer insight into the character of each individual network.</p>
<p>Specimen Box offers three ‘views’ which can be used to analyze botnet data, each offering a different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Live display of botnet activity</strong></p>
<p>In the first, ‘Board View’, all of the botnets are displayed as spheres, and every incoming message from an infected computer (more than 2,000 messages per second) is visible as a colored dot moving into the sphere. Each botnet is also assigned its own audible ‘signature’ pulse, so that the balance of activity across the botnets is represented in the balance of the overall soundscape. Additionally, geographic activity is indicated through the speaking of city names, allowing the user to experience the diversity of locations from which the infected machines are ‘calling home’.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100818042?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="850" height="478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3081.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1196" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3081-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_3081" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3069.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1195" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3069-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_3069" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Examine botnets in-depth</strong></p>
<p>The second view, ‘Portrait View’, allows for a deep analysis of an individual botnet’s activity. Circular ‘retina plots’ show the complete activity of a bot over a default time period of 24 hours, displaying up to 500 million messages in a single visualization. IP addresses of the infected computer are presented in a circular array.  Using an innovative radial selection interface, investigators can select and zoom into any section of this data, allowing a quick drill-down to the IP level.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100818043?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="850" height="478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1197" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3015-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_3015" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Sorting the haystack</strong></p>
<p>By default, the IP addresses are sorted around the circle by the level of communication activity. The huge data set has been optimized to allow researchers to instantly re-sort the IPs by longitude or by similarity. “Longitude Sort Mode” arranges the IPs geographically from east to west, while “Similarity Sort Mode” groups together IPs that have similar activity patterns over time, allowing analysts to see which groups of machines within the botnet are behaving the same way. These similarity clusters may represent botnet control groups, research activity from universities or other institutions, or machines with unique temporal patterns such as printers.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100818431?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="850" height="478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Sonification</strong></p>
<p>One of the key features of Portrait View is the sonification of botnet activity. The density of the data within these plots means that it can be hard for our eyes to detect pattern or interesting anomalies. However, our ears have a much higher temporal resolution, meaning that we’re able to hear things that we may not otherwise notice.</p>
<p>A visible “playhead” continually sweeps the selected data.  The user can control the direction of the sweep, allowing it to move either according to time or IP address.  Through an exploratory process of selecting, zooming, and altering the characteristics of the sonification playhead, users can discover behavioral and geographic patterns within the data, aiding their efforts to fully understand the nature of each botnet.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100818432?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="850" height="478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Immediate comparisons</strong></p>
<p>Botnets’ activity sometimes changes dramatically from day to day, or from month to month, so analysts will want to compare a botnet’s activity botnet on different days, or compare two botnets on the same day. To facilitate this, we developed a functionality we call ‘cleaving’, which allows the user to split the portrait view at any time using a simple multi-touch gesture. The split-screens can be merged again by reversing the gesture.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100818434?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="850" height="478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3026.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1202" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3026-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_3026" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>In the third view, ‘Graph View’, users can examine the character of individual botnets by plotting them on graphs with one, two, or three axes. Again, users can cleave these visualizations in order to facilitate comparison. An intuitive interface allows for easy addition and removal of axes and variables, making it easy to compare the data across various dimensions.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100818435?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="850" height="478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3041.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1205" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3041-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_3041" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With Specimen Box, The OCR set out to visualize a vast and dynamic set of data in a way that engaged with the character of the system from which it came &#8212; that of botnets. We wanted to allow for interaction with this data at greatly different scales, using multi-touch gestures and advanced computation techniques to facilitate a responsive, seamless experience. We also focused on bridging two very different data representation techniques, sonification and visualization, allowing each to do what it does best. Ultimately, the core goal for the tool is to facilitate question farming: we want give the DCU an instrument which will allow them to ask critical questions about botnets, the people who build them, and the people who are affected by them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> is a public agency. This means that while they’re not hurtling objects into space, measuring the earth in novel ways, developing clever technologies, or freeze-drying foods, they’re filing reports. Lots of reports. For example, every year since 1958, NASA has released ‘<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/timeline.html">Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics Chronologies</a>’, which outline the agency’s aerospace activities in science, technology and policy. For the July issue of <a href="http://www.popsci.com/">Popular Science</a>, we made a 4-page, 3,460-word visualization which tells the story of NASA’s history in the agency’s own words.</p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_2969CCselect.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1174" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_2969CCselect-1024x693.jpg" alt="The Whole Brilliant Enterprise" width="640" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>We started the project by reading through the NASA chronologies, in order to construct an understanding of the type of content they contained. We found that while the reports are extremely descriptive of the history of the US aerospace industry, but they lack a sense of hierarchy– they are straightforward timelines recounting various events. For example, a story about the hiring of a new NASA employee placed alongside a story of a shuttle launch, representing chronological order but not relative importance. To address this, we turned to the archives of The New York Times. First, we used the <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs">NYT’s open APIs</a> to search out article headlines and snippets related to NASA. Using the articles&#8217; placement in the paper (front page vs. middle of a back section) as a determiner of cultural impact, we assigned a ‘weight’ to each story in the chronologies. We also used this PopSci/NYT bridge to categorize each story from the chronologies. The final graphic uses six categories: satellites, the Moon, research &amp; development, rockets, the space shuttle, and Russia. Sorted and weighted stories were then passed through a custom-built Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline which allowed us to extract people and places, as well as interesting words and phrases. For example, for a story about the Moon, we might extract people (Neil Armstrong, John F. Kennedy) or geographical locations (Cape Canaveral, the Sea of Tranquility). We can also look at verbs ending with ‘ing’ (landing, engineering, orbiting, planning), or phrases with a determiner, an adjective and a noun (the lunar surface, the Soviet Union, the White House). Within the each category, these extracted words and phrases were then placed into positions on the timeline which most closely match their ‘ideal moment’. Elements which are used more often appear larger, while elements that are specific to their categories appear more brightly. The result is a fluid timeline, which like the history of NASA carries a diverse cast of characters and places along with a nuanced and shifting range of language.</p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_2950.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1178" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_2950-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_2950" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_2951.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1177" src="http://o-c-r.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_2951-1024x682.jpg" alt="IMG_2951" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the whole visualization in person by picking up a copy of July&#8217;s Popular Science. A web-based version will also be released in the coming days. <em>The Whole Brilliant Enterprise</em> was built using <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>. Text analysis was hugely assisted by Daniel Howe’s excellent <a href="http://rednoise.org/rita/">RiTa toolkit</a>.</p>

print and site-specific installations.   Through OCR, we will continue<br />
our individual work and  also expand our collective practice, learning<br />
from each other as well as from new client-focused research projects.</p>
<p>2. Scope</p>
<p>OCR design products are the  output of a research process that engages<br />
the client as a collaborator. A project&#8217;s scope might include:</p>
<p> * Protocols (human or machine) for collecting or repurposing data,</p>
<p> * Tools  (software   and/or  hardware)  for   gathering,  organizing,<br />
   interpreting, and computing with data, and</p>
<p> * Presentation techniques for visualizing and interacting with data.</p>
<p>In addition to  client-focused work, we will document  our process and<br />
promote  like-minded  creative  practices  through  journal  articles,<br />
curricular materials and a regular workshop series.</p>
<p>3. Conclusions and future work</p>
<p>Data and data processing tools (read software), provide a flat terrain<br />
across  which   disciplinary  boundaries  disappear.    New  forms  of<br />
creativity are emerging from the  cross-breeding made possible  by new<br />
technologies and  problems that inspired their creation.  As of today,<br />
the  Office for Creative  Research is  setting out  to explore  and to<br />
cultivate this new creative territory.</p>
